# Bioinformatics Project

This directory contains the following structure:

- data/: Contains input data files, such as FASTA files.
- scripts/: Python scripts for generating and analyzing biological sequences.
    - generate_fasta.py: Script to generate FASTA files.
    - dna_operations.py: Script for performing various DNA operations.
    - find_cutsites.py: Script to identify restriction enzyme cut sites in DNA sequences.
- results/: Contains output files and results from the analyses.
    - cutsite_summary.txt: Summary of restriction cut sites.
    
This project aims to automate bioinformatics analyses by organizing data, scripts, and results systematically.
